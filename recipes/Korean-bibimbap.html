<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>English cucumber</li>
    <li>fresh spinach</li>
    <li>soy sauce</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>carrots</li>
    <li>garlic</li>
    <li>red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>beef top round steak</li>
    <li>eggs</li>
    <li>white rice</li>
    <li>sesame oil</li>
    <li>sesame seeds</li>
    <li>gochujang</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside.</li>
    <li>Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; cook until bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach(cut into thin strips) aside in a bowl and stir in soy sauce.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir carrots(cut into matchstick pieces) until softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in garlic(minced) and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in cucumber(cut into matchsticks) mixture; sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Set carrot mixture aside in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes per side; set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces of beef(thinly sliced), and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.</li>
